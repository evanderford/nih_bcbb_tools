# NIH BCBB Tools

Here you will find a couple pipelines I wrote to simplify molecular dynamics simulations.

## md_pipeline_desktop

Generates input files for various MD simulation programs. The only user interaction is modifying a configuration file; everything else is taken care of.

## md_pipeline_locus

For use specifically on NIAID Locus HPC cluster

## mdff_pipeline_desktop

Generates input files for molecular dynamics flexible fitting (MDFF) simulations to be used with cryo-EM data.

## mdff_pipeline_biowulf

For use on NIH Biowulf HPC cluster
